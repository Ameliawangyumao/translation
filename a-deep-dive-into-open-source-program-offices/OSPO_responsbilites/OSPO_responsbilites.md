## **OSPO Responsibilities**
The OSPO assumes different responsibilities that change over time. In the following subsections, we explore these responsibilities and discuss them at length. You can also explore these responsibilities in this interactive OSPO mind map.
### **Develop and Execute an Open Source Strategy**
Since the beginning of the software industry, nearly every software organization has followed the same business model as follows: source code was developed by its employees or licensed from a third party, intellectual property was closely held, and software was delivered in a binary format to its clients. However, the availability of enterprise-grade OSS is changing how organizations develop and deliver products. With open access to source code and transparent development communities, software providers can reduce development costs while remaining active participants in the development process. In addition, end users of the software can also be active in the development process by contributing directly to upstream projects rather than be passive recipients of what the software vendor delivers to them. This development model enables organizations to think differently about how they procure, implement, test, deploy, and maintain software. In this report, we explore the following four basic strategies for organizations that utilize and integrate OSS in their products: consumer, participant, contributor, and leader.

FIGURE 9 illustrates the following four primary OSS strategies: consumption, participation, contribution, and leadership. Each strategy requires organizations to be successful at the previous strategy. How far your organization advances up this ladder is entirely dependent upon its objectives and overall open source strategy.
These four strategies overlap as organizations transition from one position into another. Typically, the early stages are engineering-driven due to engineers using open source components in product development. Initially, their participation in strategic projects may be limited to joining the conversation or making small contributions. Over time, this usage can grow within the organization and become part of the business strategy as it gains traction.
Some organizations can achieve their goals simply by being consumers of open source code and are content to stay at that level while others have ambitions to attain certain leadership positions. As it is likely that your organization is already at one of these levels of the ladder, it is important to identify both your current position on the ladder and your target position.
### **Consumer Scenario**
The common starting point is the adoption of OSS and integration of OSS in products and services. Voraciously consuming open source components will increase your ability to differentiate products and services and reduce your overall time and costs in delivering those products and services. The following action items are essential to this strategy:
- Set up an open source review board to serve as a clearinghouse for all open source activities, including license compliance.
- Use a strategic classification scheme to guide decisions on what OSS to consume.
- Create an inventory of all software that is used via SBOM to enable a more granular view of the licenses of the OSS in use to determine whether the enterprise is complying with all license obligations and identify any known security vulnerabilities.
- Deploy automated workflow software for evaluating/approving open source usage.
- Create a plan for incremental investment in head count and infrastructure in engineering, product management, and legal to manage a complex mix of closed and open source software.

When establishing a software strategy that encourages the use of OSS in commercial products, the following actions can be taken to ensure the successful adoption of OSS:
- Communicate the strategy for the use of OSS.
- Educate staff on open source compliance, license obligations, and the open source development model.
- Establish explicit criteria for determining which OSS is a candidate for inclusion in your products. Examples include the availability of new features, the maturity of the project’s source code, the size and composition of the project’s development community, and other factors that measure the state of the code and the people who maintain it.
- Establish an open source compliance program to ensure that you have the processes in place to meet the license obligations of the OSS that you are using in your products.
- Encourage your developers to identify and adopt open source development tools that can enable better internal collaboration, increased and transparent team communication, and faster development cycles.
- Encourage your staff to subscribe to open source mailing lists and
magazines, follow blogs, and participate in discussion forums.
- Encourage and fund staff’s attendance at open source conferences for learning and networking opportunities.
- Join open source industry bodies and foundations, such as The Linux Foundation, for opportunities to share development and legal best practices with other leaders in the industry.
- Hire developers from the open source community.
- Host local open source user groups and encourage your staff to
get involved in local open source activities.
- Invite community members to present to your development team on topics that are related to the project.
### **Participant Scenario**
Once your organization is successfully using OSS in products or services, you can expand your strategy to participate in the open source community. Unless you have already hired experienced developers, you may need to engage more closely with the community, increase your visibility, and begin attracting the talent that you need.
The following action items are essential to participation:
- Monitor community communication platforms, such as chat servers, mailing lists, forums, and websites, to keep on top of project developments.
- Attend relevant conferences and meetups to establish relationships within the community.
- Sponsor project events and foundations to improve the enterprise’s visibility.

### **Contributor Scenario**
Once your enterprise realizes the benefits of participating regularly in the community, you can assess the advantages of contributing code to projects and communities. As code contributors help to shape future features, contributing source code to those open source projects that are critical to your business objectives is the best way to influence those projects and build a positive reputation. The following action items are
essential to this scenario:
- Educate your team on community development best practices.
- Actively participate and drive technical discussions on the mailing list, Slack, discussion forums, etc.
- Follow the open source community’s established working methods and processes.
- File bug reports and contribute fixes to existing bugs.
- Contribute code to improve or extend functionality.
- Contribute code to implement new features.
- Contribute bug fixes or other security measures
- Contribute to documentation efforts.
- Contribute to testing and integration efforts (e.g., write test code, create test cases).
- Listen to feedback on your contributions and act on it.
- Establish trust with the project maintainer and other project participants via your contributions and active participation. 
- Hire a staff director to lead the open source strategy and manage the OSPO.
- Hire contributors and committers to open source communities that are vital to your products and services.
- Deploy open source collaboration tools to support open source usage and contributions.
- Invest incrementally in engineering, product management, and legal resources to engage with external communities.
### **Leadership Scenario**
The highest form of open source strategy is leadership. Open source leaders earn their strategic positions by establishing trust with project members and maintaining a high level of continuous contribution. Leading organizations can capitalize on emerging trends in technology.

This scenario requires significant investment in targeted open source communities and consortia to establish a leadership agenda. In addition, it will require incremental investment primarily in engineering, product management, and legal to establish leadership in external communities and industry consortia. Below are some of the tactical steps that can help steer your organization toward a leadership role within a specific open source project:
Participate actively and openly within all aspects of the project, including
planning, development, testing, and release management, thereby demonstrating your capacity to act as a good steward of the project.
- Achieve a higher level of participation and contribution.
- Engage with the various project participants.
- Contribute to patching bugs, adding new features, and extending functionality in existing open source projects using the best practices, which are outlined above
- Demonstrate good faith by contributing (when relevant) proprietary source code from internal development to open source projects under an appropriate open source license that makes it usable and useful to the community.
- Publicly acknowledge that the organization has achieved tangible benefits by working with open source communities for critical software product development
- Empower employees to seek maintainer status within the project.
- Sponsor events, provide financial support for project infrastructure, and consider hiring recognized open source developers from within the project.
- Increase participation in relevant open source organizations and foundations
- Lead architectural and requirement-gathering initiatives within the various communities and consortia to achieve commercial objectives.
- Establish an open source architect role to proactively guide the use of and contributions to OSS.
While there are numerous strategic objectives to choose from, the following objectives are common among organizations that use and develop OSS:
- Reduce development costs.
- Improve the quality and flexibility of products.
- Achieve a faster time to market for products.
- Increase engineering capacity through community engagement.
- Broaden and deepen developer community commitment to your open source efforts.
### **Oversee Open Source Compliance**
Open source initiatives provide organizations with a vehicle to accelerate innovation through collaboration with open source communities.
One core responsibility for organizations is their compliance with open source licenses. Open source compliance is the process by which users, integrators, and software developers observe copyright notices and satisfy the license obligations for their OSS components.

Open source compliance helps to achieve the following four main objectives:
- Comply with open source licensing obligations.
- Facilitate effective use of OSS in commercial products and services.
- Comply with third-party software supplier contractual obligations.
- Protect commercial product differentiation.
OSPOs are generally involved in open source compliance in the following two ways:
1. They are responsible for implementing and running a complete end-to-open source compliance program, which includes the policy, process, tools, automation, education, and final fulfillment of obligations for OSS integrated into products, software, or services. <br>
Or<br>
2. They are responsible for establishing the organization’s general open source policies, and the execution and enforcement of these policies are pushed into the various divisions across the organization. For instance, ensuring open source compliance is a great example of a scenario where the OSPO is focused on policies and processes, and dedicated teams on the product side are more trusted than the actual implementation and execution of a compliance program.

The OSPO has a direct impact on the full scale of compliance responsibilities. Regardless of the specific role of an OSPO, it must have at least one individual who is very knowledgeable in open source licensing, compliance practices, and engineering.

The minimum set of individuals that represent the core compliance team includes a legal representative, an engineering or product representative, and an open source compliance expert, who is often a member of the OSPO. In the following table, we briefly present the primary roles of these individuals who form the core open source compliance team. For a detailed discussion on the topic of open source compliance, please download the free e-book Open Source Compliance in the Enterprise, which was published by The Linux Foundation. The e-book is a practical guide for organizations on how best to use open source code in products and services and legally and responsibly participate in open source communities.

![](2022-08-26-17-52-08.png)
Collectively, these three roles (legal, engineering, and compliance) are responsible for the following three main tasks:

1. Ensuring mutual compliance with third-party software and OSS licenses.

2. Facilitating the usage of and contributions to OSS.

3. Protecting proprietary intellectual property (and product differentiation) by ensuring that open source license obligations do not propagate to proprietary or third-party software.
Establish Open Source Policies and Processes The policies and processes that the OSPO needs to create depend on the organization’s current and target position on the strategy ladder.
During the first stage (consumption), the OSPO needs to implement an open source infrastructure that can support the consumption and compliance aspects of OSS. FIGURE 12 illustrates infrastructure that goes beyond a simple policy to define the organization’s guidelines for using OSS. It extends to encompass a strategy that covers usage and compliance, incorporates compliance checkpoints in the development process, establishes a team to supervise the proper usage of open source, provides the necessary training, enables tooling, and facilitates relationships with relevant open source organizations.

### **Prioritize and Drive Upstream Open Source Development**
One of the primary responsibilities of an OSPO is to improve the organization’s engagement with the key open source projects that are used in products and services. The first step is to identify where the organization relies on OSS by surveying all products and reviewing the SBOM. 
The next step is to prioritize the OSS that is already in use and establis a contribution strategy. Such a focused approach allows the OSPO to show a return on investment across multiple products. In an enterprise setting, where the OSPO and open source engineering are cost centers, the driving force should be to focus on open source projects that directly support product development.<br>
FIGURE 13 illustrates the additional elements that the OSPO needs to implement to support open source contributions.
### **Engage with Open Source Organizations**
Open source foundations are a great resource to extend your impact within the open source ecosystem. The best place to start is with foundations that host initiatives that are relevant to your products or technical interests. Many organizations find it worthwhile to get involved with well-known, established foundations, such as The Linux Foundation’s TODO Group, the Mozilla Foundation, or the Apache Foundation. If your organization is primarily concerned with legal dynamics, getting involved with organizations such as the Software Freedom Law Center or the Open Invention Network will prove valuable. The primary goal is to identify the opportunities within the
ecosystem that your organization relies on. The OSPO is the entity that drives these relationships based on the organization’s open source strategy and product priorities.
### **Track Performance Metrics**
One of the more difficult tasks for an OSPO is decision-making on key performance indicators or metrics that the office should track to incentivize engineers toward the desired behavior. The traditional metrics, which are often used in product organizations, do not apply in the context of open source development. Therefore, new metrics are required. Many OSPOs use specialized tools to track their organization’s contributions to open source projects, analyze the type of contributions from their organization, identify contribution patterns, and provide recommendations to improve the development impact.
![](2022-08-26-18-00-58.png)
### **IMPLEMENT INNERSOURCE PRACTICES**
Innersource describes the process of applying the lessons that were learned from open source development methodology to internal projects.
The goal is to incubate the same values in the enterprise as those that are
common in the collaborative, open source development model.<br>
A great method for OSPOs to expand the impact of open source is to foster internal collaboration using innersource practices. These internal collaborations present incredible visibility opportunities for the OSPO with other departments or teams within the organization. In addition, such interactions and collaborations position the OSPO staff as the internal experts on open source practices and create new opportunities to collaborate with R&D and product teams.
### **GROW OPEN SOURCE TALENT INSIDE THE ORGANIZATION**
One of the core responsibilities of an OSPO is to grow the open source talent inside the organization. To do so, OSPOs can run various programs, including workshops,training, mentoring, and internal evangelizing. Education is an essential building block in an OSPO, and it falls into the following two categories: technical training to expand open source technical knowledge and compliance training to ensure that the
employees possess a good understanding of the policies that govern the use of OSS. The goal of this training is to raise awareness of open source policies and strategies to build a common understanding of the issues and facts of open source licensing and the business and legal risks of incorporating OSS in products or software portfolios. The training also serves as a venue to publicize and promote compliance policies and processes within the organization and foster a culture of compliance.<br>
Moreover, OSPOs can create mentoring programs where senior open source developers mentor junior developers, review their code commits, provide feedback on code before it is submitted to the upstream projects, and generally act as an advisor. The goal is to accelerate learning and support junior developers to become more effective and influential in open source projects.

### **OFFER ADVICE ON OPEN SOURCE**
OSPOs act as advisors on all matters related to OSS, whether they are internal issues to the organization or external issues relating to compliance, open source foundations, open standards, mergers and acquisitions, or other matters. Because of the importance of this advisory role, senior OSPO staff plays a critical role in shaping their organizations’ software strategy, as OSS is critical within the larger
software ecosystem.
### **MANAGE OPEN SOURCE IT INFRASTRUCTURE**
One of the OSPO’s challenges is to ensure that their organization provides an IT infrastructure that allows open source developers to communicate and work with the open source projects with minimal challenges. The following three primary domains of IT services are common in open source development:
1. Knowledge sharing: wikis, collaborative editing platforms, and public websites.
2. Communication and problem-solving: mailing lists, forums, and real-time chat.
3. Code development and distribution: code repositories and bug-tracking platforms.<br>

Some or all of these tools will need to be available internally to effectively support open source development. These open source practices typically require an IT infrastructure that is less restrictive than a typical corporate environment. If this situation conflicts with existing organization-wide IT policies, it is vital to resolve these conflicts and allow open source developers to use the tools that are most familiar to them.
It is worth noting that some OSPOs in large organizations create and manage their own IT infrastructure independently from their corporate IT departments. 
> ## <font color=Blue>Saying “no” is unequivocally the author’s favorite OSPO responsibility. OSPOs act as a gating function for all major contributions that leave the organization, including new projects or contributing major proprietary code. Saying “no” is the responsibility of OSPO leaders when proposals to release open source projects or contribute significant bodies of code do not meet the proper requirements for success. </font>
### **ELIMINATE FRICTION FROM USING AND CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE**
OSPOs help organizations navigate internal politics or policies, maintain relationships with communities of strategic importance, and continuously improve processes and tools to scale and reduce the learning curve and manual effort that is required.
### **SUPPORT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES**
OSPOs should be involved with open source due diligence (technical and compliance) as a part of corporate development. The two major scenarios are merger and acquisition transactions and outsourced development.
### **Mergers and Acquisitions**
If an organization is considering a merger or is the target of an acquisition, the OSPO is a great source of expertise for open source technology and compliance due diligence. OSPOs can help their organization to understand the open source code that is used by the target organization and its implications as part of the due diligence process.
### **Outsourced Development**
The OSPO can also support corporate development when negotiating the outsourced development of software, which will ensure that the proper compliance procedures are followed according to the organization’s policies and processes.
### **COLLABORATE WITH UNIVERSITIES ON OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS**
Many universities are eager to work with organizations that offer learning opportunities for their students and provide them with realworld development experience. Often, this relationship is also beneficial to the organizations that are involved because it can be a great way to develop new talent in existing open source communities and attract new development talent from a trusted source. This is particularly useful for projects that have a shortage of experienced developers and are typically more difficult to hire for. As the supply of talented programmers is limited, finding a way to tap into new knowledge and influence favorable outcomes in external projects, including academia, is vital.
### **KNOW WHEN TO SAY “NO”**
Saying “no” is unequivocally the author’s favorite OSPO responsibility. OSPOs act as a gating function for all major contributions that leave the organization, including new projects or contributing major proprietary code. Saying “no” is the responsibility of OSPO leaders when proposals to release open source projects or contribute significant bodies of code do not meet the proper requirements for success.
