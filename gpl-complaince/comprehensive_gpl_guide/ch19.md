CONCLUSION

GPL compliance need not be an onerous process. Historically, struggles
have been the result of poor de- velopment methodologies and
communications, rather than any unexpected application of the GPL's
source code disclosure requirements.

Compliance is straightforward when the entirety of your enterprise is
well-informed and well-coordinated. The receptionists should know how
to route a GPL source request or accusation of infringement. The
lawyers should know the basic provisions of Free Software licenses and
your source disclosure requirements, and should explain those details
to the software developers. The software developers should use a
version control system that allows them to associate versions of
source with distributed binaries, have a well-documented build process
that anyone skilled in the art can understand, and inform the lawyers
when they bring in new software. Managers should build systems and
procedures that keep everyone on target. With these practices in
place, any organization can comply with the GPL without serious
effort, and receive the substantial benefits of good citizenship in
the software freedom community, and lots of great code ready-made for
their products.
