### Our 20 Year Journey
### 我们20年的旅程

Like many provinces and territories in Canada, British Columbia (BC) has a long history of providing secure access to online government services. We started our journey 20 years ago with the introduction of BCeID, a simple username and password solution. A lot has changed since then!

与加拿大的许多省和地区一样，不列颠哥伦比亚省 (BC) 在提供安全访问线上政府服务的方面有着悠久的历史。 20年前我们引入了 BCeID，一个简单的用户名和密码解决方案，开始了我们的旅程。 从那以后很多事情改变了！

Today, we are investing in Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and a digital wallet. We see these as the cornerstones in the evolution of our digital strategy, adding a much needed layer of trust to the digital economy. 

今天，我们正在投资可验证凭证 (VC) 和数字钱包。 我们将这些看作是数字战略发展的基石，为数字经济增添了必要的信任层。

We want to share what we are doing, why we focus on interoperability and open-source, and why we are excited about VCs being our natural next step.

我们想分享当下正在做的事情，告诉大家我们为什么关注互操作性和开源项目，以及为什么我们对可验证凭证 (VC) 成为下一个目标感到兴奋。

### Why We Care
### 我们关注的原因
As a public sector organization, BC has a strong interest in seeing the adoption of technologies that are secure, privacy-preserving, and convenient. 

作为一个公共部门组织，不列颠哥伦比亚省 (BC)  对关于安全、隐私保护和使用便捷的技术方案有着浓厚的兴趣。

Digital is obviously everywhere. In 2021, 94% of BC citizens said they are online, and 90% of Canadians have smartphones. Also, according to the Business Council of Canada, in the last decade Canada’s digital economy grew 40% faster than the overall world economy.  In Digital ID terms, this growth is an opportunity to make people’s online lives easier and safer.

数据无处不在。 2021 年，94% 的 不列颠哥伦比亚省公民表示他们在线使用网络，90% 的加拿大人都拥有智能手机。 此外，根据加拿大商业委员会的数据，在过去十年中，加拿大的数字经济增长速度比世界整体经济的增长速度快 40%。 在数字身份 ID 方面，这种经济增长提供了一个机会，可以让人们的在线生活更轻松、更安全。

We also know that cybersecurity threats are growing and there are no signs of it slowing down. BC sees an astonishing 496 million unauthorized access attempts per day – that’s 5,741 every second! Identity theft and fraud also continues to rise. We need digital trust solutions that counter this increasing risk.

我们也知道网络安全威胁正在增长，并且没有放缓的迹象。 不列颠哥伦比亚省每天都有 4.96 亿次未经授权的访问尝试（即每秒 5,741 次），这数字非常惊人！ 身份盗用和身份欺诈也在持续上升。 我们急需数字信任解决方案，来应对这种日益增长的网络风险。

In responding to this new reality, we recognize that people are familiar and comfortable with the many credentials that governments issue today. Things like physical copies of drivers’ licenses, health cards, passports, permits, and reports are widely accepted and trusted.  In BC, we are building on that trust and moving towards providing the same things digitally. We are also enabling confidential connections through the wallet to give people choice and confidence in their digital lives.  

在应对这一现实时，我们发现人们对当今政府颁发的许多证书都很熟悉，使用也很自如。 诸如驾驶执照、健康卡、护照、许可证和报告之类的实物复印件，已被广泛接受和认可。 在不列颠哥伦比亚省，我们期望实现以数字化方式提供相同的证书，并尝试建立大家对数字化证书的信任。 我们还尝试提供数字钱包以实现机密连接，让人们在数字生活中有选择、有信心。

### BC’s Approach 
### 不列颠哥伦比亚省的方式
Clearly, digital trust goes far beyond just the government. Canadians expect more access, with greater security, to high-value services in both the public and private sectors. VCs and the wallet provide a highly flexible way to achieve that goal.

Collaboration is critical to achieving that goal and it’s important to us. BC’s Chief Information Officer, CJ Ritchie, strongly advocates for us working together to meet the expectations of Canadians.  She notes, “If we don’t all act together to deliver solutions that protect privacy and interact securely, trust will erode and there will be negative impacts for businesses, people’s livelihoods, and the broader digital economy.”

As our approach evolves, we also remain keen to support open source solutions that interoperate with other national and international efforts. There is no dominant design yet, no one network or technology, so we must remain nimble and flexible in our exploration. We also need to coexist with existing identity solutions that millions of British Columbians already rely upon.

### Technology Interoperability
In exploring VCs, BC is contributing to solutions that allow agents to verify credentials from multiple networks. Indeed, through one of our Code With Us initiatives, DID indy, we contributed over 11,000 lines of open-source code to support and prove the viability of a “network of networks”.

We also are focused on the interoperability of Hyperledger Aries agents themselves, another key success metric.  We are leading contributors to Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH), open-source software that runs a series of Hyperledger Aries interoperability tests and delivers the results to the AATH website. Great interoperability requires that we test—and re-test!—that interoperability on a regular basis.

### Side note: If you want to test the interoperability of any Aries agent with this ecosystem, please sign up to join the Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Event on August  31.

### Driving Adoption
In BC we have a lot of technical skill in working with VCs and with Hyperledger Aries agents. However, for VCs to be successful, it needs to be easy for others to join in. 

On the agents side, to complement our extensive contributions to Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and other Aries and Indy projects, we also contribute to Hyperledger Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ), the agent commonly used for mobile digital wallets. 

That’s why, when thinking about mobile digital wallets, we opted to contribute to the Hyperledger Aries Bifold project, helping it also essentially become “Bifold as a framework”. Bifold uses AFJ, and BC and others can use it to easily deploy a custom-designed digital wallet. Jurisdictions within Canada and elsewhere in the world are already taking this approach for their own wallet explorations. It’s an open-source stack right the way down.

VC adoption will be helped by a thriving open-source community, and we are giving back wherever we can.

### Open-Source Success
We believe the community’s success becomes our success. For years we’ve been committed to open-source, interoperable solutions in this space. Our approach is always evolving, but our contributions and commitment to various digital trust open-source projects and technologies continue.

We hope that even more organizations will join in and contribute. Our goal in BC is a new layer of trust for the internet, making it easier for people to work and play online with confidence.
