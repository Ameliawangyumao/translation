Project branding
================

Project branding includes a number of activities that should be
considered and are discussed in the following subsections.

Develop a trademark strategy and policy
---------------------------------------

-   Agree on a name/mark for the project.

-   Perform a knockout search to determine whether the registrations
    will succeed.

-   Specify internal contact for trademark (if not counsel).

-   Develop a registration strategy:

° Which classes of goods/services apply?

° Which countries to prioritize?

-   Register the tradename and trademark.

Domain names
------------

-   Register domains and set up redirects.

Creative assets
---------------

-   Create the logo, logo package, and visual assets.

-   Create and publish on the website the logo usage guidelines.

Register external accounts
--------------------------

-   Set up the project organization name on GitHub.

-   Set up \@projectname on various social media platforms such as
    Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.

Develop a certification/compliance strategy
-------------------------------------------

-   Decide the criteria projects must meet to claim compatibility with
    the parent project.

<!-- -->

-   Create a specification document and tools that can verify whether a
    custom build of the project complies with the specification.

-   Agree on the name/mark for the certification program.

-   Develop a trademark policy/FAQ if you wish to control the use of the
    project name. Ask these questions to drive a conversation on the
    topic:

° May distributors, user groups, or developers register domain names
that include the project's name?

° Will the project run certification programs allowing others to use
the mark for modified products?

-   Create a certification test suite.

-   Establish a contract with a testing facility.

-   Schedule the first year of plugfests.

Recruit business partners
-------------------------

-   Approach business partners that will benefit the most from the
    project for public support on launch day.

-   Secure commitments from key partners to encourage employee
    participation in the project and have some basic commitments.

-   Approach compatible projects, communicate how the new project will
    benefit them and prepare them for the announcement.

-   Anticipate conflicts where existing projects misinterpret the launch
    as competition and defuse them before they start.

-   Give business partners early access to project source code.

-   Work with partners to establish a joint value proposition and
    reference stack for shared customers.

Establish project governance
----------------------------

Governance determines who has influence and control over the project
beyond what is legally required in the open source license. A
project's governance model establishes a collaboration framework that
addresses difficult questions, such as the following:

-   ####### Contributions

° Who makes decisions for code inclusion and releases, and how?

° Who can be the lead maintainer or architect for the project (larger
projects have more than one)?

° How can the project contributors become maintainers or committers?

-   ####### Direction and Finance

° How can the project raise money, and who decides how this money is
spent?

° Should the project have a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) or a
Conformance and Certification Committee? Who can be on them?

° Who decides the project's direction and road map?

-   ####### Transparency

° Who can participate in the discussions and decide on critical
matters?

° How transparent are the decision-making processes?

° Can anyone follow the discussions and meetings that take place in
the project?

-   ####### Reuse

° What compliance requirements are there for redistributing,
modifying, or using the software?

° How can the project enable contributors and downstream
redistributors to comply with these requirements?

-   ####### Copyright and Trademark

° Who owns the copyright on contributed code?

° How can users license the project's branding?

Typically, the initial maintainers of the project form the TSC of the
project. These individuals are likely from the founding orga-
nization(s) of the project. The goal is to grow the TSC over time to
include high-value contributors.

-   ####### Project governance

° Identify members of the TSC.

° Identify primary duties of the TSC, such as the following:

» Overseeing software architecture and implementation activities

» Drafting the release plan and road map

» Working with other open source projects on which the new project
depends

» Setting the criteria for accepted/rejected code

» Managing source code security issues

-   **Project processes:** A project with a high degree of openness will
    have clearly defined processes for how things work in the community
    and how to contribute to the project. For starters, a clear
    development process should outline how to incorpo- rate code into
    the project, the release process and schedule of the project, and
    any requirements developers need to meet to get their code accepted.
    This should also include guidelines for participation that
    demonstrate community best practices for things like patch
    submissions, feature requests, bug reports, and signing off on code
    contributions.

° Feature request

° Release management

° Code submission

° Bug reporting

-   ####### Project agreements

° Develop a third-party contribution agreement to govern how the
project will manage contributions from the community.

Set up project infrastructure
-----------------------------

-   Documentation

-   Project website

-   Wiki

-   Community communication channels

° Mailing list

° Live chat (e.g., Slack, Internet Relay Chat (IRC))

-   Collaboration platforms

° Wiki

° GitHub repositories (or manage your own git servers)

-   Bug tracking and feature requests

-   Build system

Apply recommended practices for your GitHub repo
------------------------------------------------

1.  Use the
    [[REPOLINTER]{.underline}](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter)
    tool created by the [[TODO
    Group]{.underline}](https://todogroup.org/) to identify common
    issues in GitHub repos.

2.  Secure your GitHub account with [[two-factor
    authentication]{.underline}](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

3.  Ensure that every repo includes a **LICENSE** file.

4.  Add a **README** file to your repos welcoming new community members
    to the project and explaining why the project is useful and how to
    get started.

5.  Add a **CONTRIBUTING** file to your repos explaining how to
    contribute to the project to other developers and your

community of users. At a high level, the file would explain what types
of contributions are needed and how the process works.

6.  Add a **CODEOWNERS** file to define individuals or teams responsible
    for code in a repository.

7.  Add a **CODE \_ OF \_ CONDUCT** file that sets the ground rules for
    participants' behavior and helps facilitate a friendly, welcoming
    environment. While not every project has a **CODE \_ OF \_ CONDUCT**
    file, its presence signals that this is a

welcoming project to contribute to and defines standards for engaging
with the project's community.

8.  Provide documentation on the release methodology, cadence, criteria,
    etc.

9.  Document your project governance and make it available on the
    project's repo.

10. Add a **SUPPORT** file to let users and developers know how to get
    help with your project. You can either add how and

where this file handles security issues, put it at the project's
top-level **README**, or refer to security documentation.

11. Set up an issue template and pull request templates that help you
    customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to
    include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository.

12. Achieve and maintain your project's [[OpenSSF Best
    Practices]{.underline}](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en)
    [[Badge]{.underline}](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en)
    (previously called the Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices
    Badge).

13. Identify who will handle security issues (this could be a team) and
    set up a separate email account.

14. Consider having the project become a CNA (CVE Numbering Authority).

15. Include an SPDX short-form identifier in a comment at the top of
    each file in the repo wherever reasonably possible.

16. Adopt the [[GitHub DCO
    app]{.underline}](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce a "Signed
    off-by:" tag in each commit. The DCO is an easy way for contributors
    to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the
    code they are contributing to the project. The app enforces the DCO
    on Pull Requests. It requires all commit messages to contain the
    **Signed-off-by** line with an email address that matches the commit
    author.

17. Use English as the default universal language for anything you
    publish on GitHub. You can support a second language, but English
    should be the primary language of communica- tion toward a universal
    audience.
