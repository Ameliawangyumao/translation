Summary of recommended practices for running an open source project
===================================================================

License
-------

OSI-approved open source license offering the freedom to create and
distribute derivatives.

Governance
----------

A governance model that gives equal footing to all current and future
contributors to the project. Open source projects with an open and
transparent governance model have better chances to grow, have a
healthy environment, and attract developers and adoptees.

Access
------

Project resources are accessible to any users or developers inter-
ested in the project. Anyone can participate in the project, and any
participant can earn committer rights by contributing and building
trust with the project's community.

Processes
---------

-   General project processes are documented for requesting a feature,
    reporting bugs, submitting code, etc.

-   Source code contributions are only committed through the project's
    defined process for incoming contributions.

-   All code goes through a peer review process.

-   The process to become a committer/maintainer/reviewer is enforced by
    the project for consistency.

-   The project's community revises its processes based on incoming
    feedback to ensure they continue to meet the project's needs as it
    grows and scales.

 Development
-----------

-   Responsibility for development is allocated to the individuals with
    the best capacity to deliver.

-   The project enforces quality standards when merging code.

-   The project implements multiple levels of review before entering the
    final release.

-   Peer review is mandatory and public.

Community
---------

-   Accessible to newcomers---open development generally strives for
    inclusiveness.

-   Focused on visibility with emphasis on open decision-making
    processes and communication.

-   Self-organizing; individuals contribute in their areas of interest
    or those of their employers.

-   Resilient to organizational change, given that leadership comes with
    experience. If individuals cease to participate, there are others to
    take their place.

Community structure
-------------------

-   Meritocracy drives advancement and acceptance. Contributors who
    provide the most value to the community are granted project
    leadership roles.

-   The project welcomes newcomers who have the freedom and access to
    participate in public discussions, development, and testing.

    -   []{#_bookmark12 .anchor}The project's hierarchy is scalable
        because it consists of maintainers who oversee specific bodies
        of code in levels that can be added or removed as needed based
        on the size of the community.

    -   Anyone can submit patches, and both developers and users are
        involved in the testing process. The roles of developer and user
        are closely integrated with open source development, allowing
        users to have a more direct path to influencing the project.

Releases
--------

-   To protect certain users from the instability of rapidly developing
    software, projects provide stable releases that restrict the
    addition of experimental features to provide a reliable version that
    better supports use cases that rely on stability.

-   Weekly or monthly stable releases provide users and developers with
    the newest functionality after it has been tested.

-   Long-term stable versions extend to longer periods and often only
    include security patches and bug fixes.

-   The project has a defined cadence for its releases, with set goals
    per release.

-   The release cadence and the goals to be met by each release are
    known to all project stakeholders.

 Communication tools
-------------------

Tools, including mailing lists, Slack, and IRC, are available and open
to anyone wishing to participate in the project.

Transparency
------------

Open source communities must be as transparent as possible to attract
new participation, such as contribution transparency, peer review
transparency, transparency of discussions, and transparency of
promotion to committer or maintainer.

Documentation
-------------

Availability of documentation covering architecture, APIs, instal-
lation guides, developer guides, development processes, partici-
pation guides, tutorials, etc.
