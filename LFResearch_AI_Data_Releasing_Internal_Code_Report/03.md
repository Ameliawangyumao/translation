Initial investigations
======================

When open sourcing proprietary technology, it is important to
thoroughly evaluate the reasons for the transition and align

internal incentives and metrics accordingly. Open sourcing for the
wrong reasons could have the opposite effect than is originally
intended. To successfully open source a project, you must have the
right reasons or motivations.

Make the business case to open source
-------------------------------------

There are many sound business reasons for open sourcing propri- etary
code, such as the following:

-   Strengthening the ecosystem for the product or service you are
    building

-   Improving product quality by engaging business partners and
    customers in enhancing features and fixing bugs

-   Providing a reference implementation to a standard, thereby driving
    the adoption of your software as a de facto implementation

-   Commoditizing non-strategic layers of a software stack

-   Pushing the value line higher and forcing more innovation

-   Partnering with open source communities and increasing goodwill
    within the developer communities

Equally, there are many counterproductive reasons to open source
proprietary code. These arguments should act as red flags:

-   You want others to maintain a codebase you still need so that you
    can stop investing in that code

-   You want to retire code with unique functionality that you will no
    longer maintain or use in your products

<!-- -->

-   The source code links directly to code you cannot release under an
    open source license

Now that you have a business case for open sourcing your code at your
organization, the next step is to determine the actual path to open
source.

Evaluate possible ways to open source
-------------------------------------

There is no single way to achieve the possible goal, and it's not an
exercise that your organization has to do alone. In most cases, there
are multiple options that you can explore, such as the following:

-   Evaluate the technology and determine whether you should open source
    any other components

-   Analyze existing open source projects your company could join as a
    major participant, reducing your need to create new infrastructure
    and a new community

-   Explore the possibility of launching the planned open source project
    with some of your existing clients and partners

-   Evaluate the option of launching and hosting the planned open source
    project in an open source foundation with a record of launching and
    sustaining successful open source projects.
