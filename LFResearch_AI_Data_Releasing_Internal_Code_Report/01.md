===========================================================================

Corporate participation in open source has reached an all-time high
and continues to grow as companies realize the value of consuming and
contributing to open source projects. The nature of corporate
participation continues to evolve, as companies increasingly discover
that open sourcing proprietary technologies can create new sources of
value and stronger product ecosystems.

Open sourcing a proprietary technology involves far more than just
making the source code available. There are many ways of building or
joining communities to use and help maintain the project, which is why
it should be a well-ordered and deliberate process.

For companies that plan to open source proprietary code as a
standalone open source project, this paper offers a high-level
overview of the process and provides a sample checklist that can help
ensure that all tasks are properly captured and executed.
