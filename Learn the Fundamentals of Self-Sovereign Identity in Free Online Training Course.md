Our digital identities are part of who we are. Technology has become so pervasive in everyday life that individuals want and need the ability to better manage 
their online digital identity. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a concept that puts users at the center of their digital identity, giving them control over it which 
helps increase privacy, security and trust in a technology or organization. SSI is growing in popularity as more online websites and applications implement the 
practice in their user experience.

数字身份是我们自身的一部分。科技已经渗透到了我们的日常生活中，人们希望并需要有能力管理好自己的线上数字身份。自我主权身份(SSI)提出了一个概念，将用户置于数字身份中心，使得人们能够控制它，这有助于增加技术或组织的隐私性、安全性和信任度。随着越来越多的在线网站和应用程序在用户体验中采用这种做法，SSI越来越受欢迎。

We want to make it easier for companies to implement SSI for the benefit of their users, so Linux Foundation Training & Certification has announced a new 
upcoming online training course, [Getting Started with Self-Sovereign Identity (LFS178x)](https://www.edx.org/course/getting-started-with-self-sovereign-identity?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=linuxfoundation&utm_content=blog-lfs178). The six-to-seven hour course, which will be available to audit for free for 10 weeks on the edX learning platform, provides a solid foundation on SSI with a 360 degree overview of its evolutionary journey, key concepts, standards, 
technological building blocks, use cases, real-world examples and implementation considerations. Pre-enrollment is open now, with course content becoming available 
on October 5.

This course is designed for business and government decision makers looking to understand SSI and make decisions about it; technologists seeking to get a high 
level overview of SSI, and professionals wanting to understand how digital identity systems work and how SSI is making a difference. Upon completion, participants 
will be able to have informed business discussions around digital identity, and particularly self-sovereign identity, with a good understanding about how identity 
systems work and influence our lives. You will also be able to identify innovative ideas and solutions for leveraging SSI, and be better positioned for further 
technical learning around digital identity. 

Getting Started with Self-Sovereign Identity was developed by Kaliya Young and Lucy Yang of [Identity Woman](https://identitywoman.net/), which works to bring about the creation of a layer 
of identity for people based on open standards. Kaliya, widely known as Identity Woman, is an expert in decentralized/self-sovereign identity who has committed her life 
to the development of an open standards based layer of the internet that empowers people. In 2005, Kaliya co-founded the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) to bring 
together technologists who want to see decentralized identity come into being. Lucy joined the COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI) on day one and has since led 
its operations and communications. She played an instrumental role in taking CCI into Linux Foundation Public Health. Lucy also serves on the board of MyData Global, 
an award-winning international non-profit championing personal data empowerment, and co-founded the MyData Canada Hub, where she is actively involved in strategic 
development and operations.
