Our digital identities are part of who we are. Technology has become so pervasive in everyday life that individuals want and need the ability to better manage 
their online digital identity. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a concept that puts users at the center of their digital identity, giving them control over it which 
helps increase privacy, security and trust in a technology or organization. SSI is growing in popularity as more online websites and applications implement the 
practice in their user experience.

数字身份是我们自身的一部分。科技已经渗透到了我们的日常生活中，人们希望并需要有能力管理好自己的线上数字身份。自我主权身份(SSI)提出了一个概念，将用户置于数字身份中心，使得人们能够控制它，这有助于增加技术或组织的隐私性、安全性和信任度。随着越来越多的在线网站和应用程序在用户体验中采用这种做法，SSI越来越受欢迎。

We want to make it easier for companies to implement SSI for the benefit of their users, so Linux Foundation Training & Certification has announced a new 
upcoming online training course, [Getting Started with Self-Sovereign Identity (LFS178x)](https://www.edx.org/course/getting-started-with-self-sovereign-identity?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=linuxfoundation&utm_content=blog-lfs178). The six-to-seven hour course, which will be available to audit for free for 10 weeks on the edX learning platform, provides a solid foundation on SSI with a 360 degree overview of its evolutionary journey, key concepts, standards, 
technological building blocks, use cases, real-world examples and implementation considerations. Pre-enrollment is open now, with course content becoming available 
on October 5.

为了让企业实现SSI更便捷，以服务于他们的用户，Linux培训和认证基金会宣布推出新的在线培训课程，即[自我主权身份入门 (LFS178x)](https://www.edx.org/course/getting-started-with-self-sovereign-identity?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=linuxfoundation&utm_content=blog-lfs178)。这门六到七个小时的课程将在edX学习平台上免费10周，为SSI提供坚实的基础，360度全面概述了SSI的演变过程、关键概念、标准、技术模块、用例、真实示例和实施注意事项。现已开放预注册，课程内容将于10月5日上线。

This course is designed for business and government decision makers looking to understand SSI and make decisions about it; technologists seeking to get a high 
level overview of SSI, and professionals wanting to understand how digital identity systems work and how SSI is making a difference. Upon completion, participants 
will be able to have informed business discussions around digital identity, and particularly self-sovereign identity, with a good understanding about how identity 
systems work and influence our lives. You will also be able to identify innovative ideas and solutions for leveraging SSI, and be better positioned for further 
technical learning around digital identity. 

本课程专为想要了解SSI以做出相关决策的企业和政府决策者设计；以及寻求对SSI高层次概述的技术专家，还有那些希望了解数字身份系统如何工作以及SSI如何发挥作用的专业人士。完成课程后，参与者能够就数字身份，特别是自主数字身份进行充分的业务讨论，并深入理解数字身份系统如何工作和影响我们的生活。此外，参与者还会发现关于SSI的一些创新想法和新的解决方案，从而更好地围绕有关数字身份的技术进一步学习。

Getting Started with Self-Sovereign Identity was developed by Kaliya Young and Lucy Yang of [Identity Woman](https://identitywoman.net/), which works to bring about the creation of a layer of identity for people based on open standards. Kaliya, widely known as Identity Woman, is an expert in decentralized/self-sovereign identity who has committed her life to the development of an open standards based layer of the internet that empowers people. In 2005, Kaliya co-founded the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) to bring together technologists who want to see decentralized identity come into being. Lucy joined the COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI) on day one and has since led its operations and communications. She played an instrumental role in taking CCI into Linux Foundation Public Health. Lucy also serves on the board of MyData Global, an award-winning international non-profit championing personal data empowerment, and co-founded the MyData Canada Hub, where she is actively involved in strategic development and operations. 

《自我主权身份入门》由[身份女性](https://identitywoman.net/)的Kaliya Young和Lucy Yang开发，旨在基于开放标准为人们创建一层身份。Kaliya，广为人知的“身份女性”，是去中心化/自我主权身份方面的专家，她毕生致力于开发一个基于开放标准的互联网层，赋予人们各种权力。2005年，Kaliya联合创办了互联网身份研讨会(Internet Identity Workshop,IIW)，将一批对去中心化身份寄予厚望的技术专家聚集在一起。Lucy在第一天就加入了新冠认证倡议(COVID Credentials Initiative,CCI)，此后一直负责这个项目的运营和沟通。在将CCI纳入Linux 基金会公共卫生方面，Lucy发挥了重要作用。Lucy还是MyData Global的董事会成员，她联合创立了MyData Canada Hub，并积极参与战略开发和项目运营。值得说明的是，MyData Global是一家屡获殊荣的国际非营利组织，倡导个人数据赋权。
